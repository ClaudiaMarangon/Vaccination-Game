        You both chose to {{ my_dec }}, therefore your payoff is {{ player.payoff }}.
    {% else %}
        You chose to {{ my_dec }} while your partner chose to {{ other_dec }}, therefore your payoff is {{ player.payoff }}.

    <p>
        Your guess was {{ player.prob|floatformat:0 }}, while in reality {{ subsession.choice1 }} player actually chose <b>Choice 1</b>.
        Therefore, your payoff from the belief elicitation is {{ player.elic_pay|floatformat:0 }} tokens.
