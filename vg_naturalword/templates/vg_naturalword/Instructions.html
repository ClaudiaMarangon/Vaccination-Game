    <p>
        This experiment consists of a number of stages in which you can earn experimental tokens. At the end of the
        experiment, the tokens will be exchanged for real money at a rate of ##### The experiment is expected to last
        about 1 hour.
    </p>

    <p>
        In this experiment, one game you are going to play is with two players, Player A and Player B and two choices,
        Choice 1 and Choice 2. You will be allocated the role of either Player A or Player B. Then both you and the other
        player will select Choice 1 or Choice 2. The choices will be made independently and at the same time. Your payoff
        will depend on both your and your opponent’s choice.
    </p>

    <p>
        These payoffs are displayed in the table below, in which the amount to the left in each cell is the payoff of
        Player A and the payoff to the right is that of Player B.
    </p>

    <table class='table table-bordered text-center'
           style='width: auto; margin: auto'>
        <tr>
            <th colspan=2 rowspan=2></th>
            <th colspan=2>Player B</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>Choice 1</th>
            <th>Choice 2</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th rowspan=2 style="vertical-align: middle">Player A</th>
            <th>Choice 1</th>
            <td>5, 5</td>
            <td>5, 10</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>Choice 2</th>
            <td>10, 5</td>
            <td>2, 2</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <p>
        For example, if Player A selects Choice 2 while Player B selects Choice 1, then A receives 10 tokens and B
        receives 5 tokens.
    </p>

    <p>
        Each player will choose whether they want to play Choice 1 or Choice 2, and then the computer will match the
        answers and calculate the appropriate payoffs. You will play the game above several times, in different roles,
        and against different partners. Your payoffs for each round will be added and will contribute to your final
        earnings at the end of the experiment.
