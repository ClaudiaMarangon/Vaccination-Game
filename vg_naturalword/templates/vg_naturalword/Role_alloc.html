    <p>You have been allocated in the role of: <b>{{ player.role }}</b></p>

    <p>
        You will now play 10 rounds as  <b>{{ my_role }}</b>. For every round, you will be randomly paired with a
        different  <b>{{ other_role }}</b>, such that you will never play two rounds in a row with the same partner.
        After 10 rounds, you will play another game for 30 more rounds.
