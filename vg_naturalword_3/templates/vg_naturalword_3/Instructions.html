   Three Players Game
{% endblock %}

{% block content %}

    <p>
        In this part of the experiment you will be allocated to the role of one of the three players, A, B, or C.
        Then Players A and B will select Choice 1 or Choice 2. The choices will be made independently and at the same time.
        Your payoff will depend on both your and your opponentâ€™s choice. Player C has no action in this game, but note
        that his/her payoff depends on the other players' actions.
    </p>

    <p>
        These payoffs are displayed in the table below, in which the amount to the left in each cell is the payoff of
        Player A, in the middle is the payoff of Player B and on the right is the payoff of Player C.
    </p>

    <table class='table table-bordered text-center'
           style='width: auto; margin: auto'>
        <tr>
            <th colspan=2 rowspan=2></th>
            <th colspan=2>Player B</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>Choice 1</th>
            <th>Choice 2</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th rowspan=2 style="vertical-align: middle">Player A</th>
            <th>Choice 1</th>
            <td>5, 5, 5</td>
            <td>5, 10, 2</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>Choice 2</th>
            <td>10, 5, 2</td>
            <td>2, 2, 0</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <p>
        For example, if Player A selects Choice 2 while Player B selects Choice 1, then A receives 10 tokens, B receives
        5 tokens and C receives 2 tokens.
    </p>

    <p>
        Players A and B will choose whether they want to play Choice 1 or Choice 2, and then the computer will match the
        answers and calculate the appropriate payoffs. You will play the game above several times, in different roles,
        and against different partners. Your payoffs for each round will be added and will contribute to your final
        earnings at the end of the experiment.
